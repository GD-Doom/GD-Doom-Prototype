Level7Text="You gloat over the steaming carcass of the\n"
  "Guardian.  With its death, you've wrested\n"
  "the Accelerator from the stinking claws\n"
  "of Hell.  You relax and glance around the\n"
  "room.  Damn!  There was supposed to be at\n"
  "least one working prototype, but you can't\n"
  "see it. The demons must have taken it.\n"
  "\n"
  "You must find the prototype, or all your\n"
  "struggles will have been wasted. Keep\n"
  "moving, keep fighting, keep killing.\n"

  "collapses, an inverted Gate forms and\n"
  "sucks down the shards of the last\n"
  "prototype Accelerator, not to mention the\n"
  "few remaining demons.  You're done. Hell\n"
  "has gone back to pounding bad dead folks \n"
  "instead of good live ones.  Remember to\n"
  "tell your grandkids to put a rocket\n"

  "when you die, you'll need it for some\n"
  "final cleaning-up ...";

Level31Text="You've found the second-hardest level we\n"
